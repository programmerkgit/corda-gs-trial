# What is state
State is agreed upon state such as who has that car now, or how much claim you have.  

## Features of the state.  
1. This state is guaranteed to be signed by both party, so a contract is assumed to surely exist.

### Problem of state.  
What if mistakenly signed state, and cannot be executed what is denoted by state ? 
Unlike contract, state is not low.  State only helps estimation that certain agreement surely exists.  
However, synchronized data sharing by private and secure way is a notable feature.

### Difference with relying on SaaS.  
Even If you trusted SaaS, You can't archive creating contract logic on your own.  
I think programmable, configurable data sharing service can replace blockchain architecture.
