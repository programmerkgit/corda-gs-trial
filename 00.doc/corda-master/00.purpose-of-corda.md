# Purpose of corda
Data synchronization by decentralized and private way.  

## Drawback of data synchronization by one party 
Data synchronization is easily archived by maintaining database by a single party.  
But this has two limitation.
1. Centralized Control over data.  
2. Lack Of data privacy.  

### 1.Centralized control over data.
1. If data was centralized, the data accessibility is not guaranteed.  
2. Data may be deleted arbitrary.  

### 2.Lack of data privacy.  
Database has open data and private data.  
Data to be synchronized should be open for both party, but database has private data two.  

The solution to 1 and 2 is corda.  
Corda share only data to be synchronized, and put those data under the control of both party.
